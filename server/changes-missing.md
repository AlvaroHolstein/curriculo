# TODOS

- Sincronize multiple accounts, when a user has to accounts open in diferent devices. __(Partly Done) it's still missing the part where i sincronize the messages from the users, the messages i send from discord are received in all the user's open accounts__
- Fazer com que o refresh da página não envie o user para login, a não ser que o token tenha expirado (done, but recheck behaviour when token expire), __Should be Done.__  __(Done)__
- Let User change he's data
- change pictures xD
- eliminate the possibilitie of duplicated messages from discord. 
    - Tried this again, maybe it's solved because the problems was also that discord was ready too many times
    - __(DONEEEE)__
- Do geust Account?
- Use Algolia or another "text indexer" and bring back the search
- make the AGE in additional information not be hard coded (tricky) __(DONE)__
- Docker the hell out of this.
